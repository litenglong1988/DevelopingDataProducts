Developing Data Products by Coursera

First, to answer the first question of coursera project, you can see the server.R and ui.R file on my github repo.

And there are two methods you can open the shiny:

- 1. download the ui.R and server.R file in your R working directory and run the list code:
library(shiny);runApp()

- 2. I have already upload my shiny projet on the web, so open the "shinyapps" link: https://litenglong1988.shinyapps.io/BodyMassIndex/ 

Second , to answer the second question of coursera project, you can open my slidify link as follow:
