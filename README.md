Developing Data Products by Coursera

there are two methods you can open the shiny:

- you can download the ui.R and server.R in your R working directory and run the list code:
library(shiny);runApp()

- I have already upload my shiny projet on the web, so open the "shinyapps" link: https://litenglong1988.shinyapps.io/BodyMassIndex/
