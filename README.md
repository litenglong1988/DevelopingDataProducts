Developing Data Products by Coursera

First, to answer the first coursera project question, you can see the server.R and ui.R code on my github repo.

And there are two methods you can open the shiny:

- you can download the ui.R and server.R in your R working directory and run the list code:
library(shiny);runApp()

- I have already upload my shiny projet on the web, so open the "shinyapps" link: https://litenglong1988.shinyapps.io/BodyMassIndex/ 

On the other side, to answer the second question, you can open my slidify as follow link:
