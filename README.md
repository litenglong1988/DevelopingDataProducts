Developing Data Products by Coursera

for answer the coursera homework, you can see the server.R and ui.R code on my github repo.

And there are two methods you can open the shiny:

- you can download the ui.R and server.R in your R working directory and run the list code:
library(shiny);runApp()

- I have already upload my shiny projet on the web, so open the "shinyapps" link: https://litenglong1988.shinyapps.io/BodyMassIndex/ 

On the other you can open my slidify as follow link:
